Hi, I'm Jenna 👋  

💻 **Computer Science Grad | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Software Developer**  


I use this GitHub to document my journey in **cybersecurity engineering** and **software development**.  
Here you’ll find a mix of hands-on security labs and coding projects that highlight my technical skills, curiosity, and growth mindset.  

📚 **Currently Accomplished**  
- Securiti's AI Security and Governance Certificate ✅
- [Simulated Password Cracker](https://github.com/JennaStowell/password_cracker) ✅
- CompTIA+ Security Cert  *🟢 (In Progress)*

**Here are some of my *goals*:**

🔐 **Cybersecurity Projects**  
- Configuring and hardening firewalls & intrusion detection systems  
- Security-focused labs (network monitoring, endpoint protection, threat simulations)  
- Documenting best practices and lessons learned along the way  

💡 **Software Development Projects**  
- Full-stack web applications (Next.js, JavScript, PostgreSQL)  
- Automation scripts and tools for security analysis  
- Exploratory coding projects (e.g., a web crawler for email pattern analysis and phishing defense research)
